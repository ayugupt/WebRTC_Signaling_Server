# WebRTC_Signaling_Server

This is a signaling server used to exchange SDP information and ICE candidates between users. It is made using node.js.

Make sure you have installed node.js, npm and then the websocket(ws) library from npm. This Server also keeps track of all users which have logged in and can communicate.

To create the local server, type "node server.js" in the terminal in the directory where server.js is stored.

NOTE - The code used here is mainly referenced from this tutorial --> https://www.tutorialspoint.com/webrtc/webrtc_signaling.htm, go through this to understand it better.
